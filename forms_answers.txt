BLOWFISH RESPONSE - READY TO SEND
================================================================================

Subject: Re: Ticket #10986 - TopMemes.io Whitelist Request - signAndSendTransaction Implemented

Hello Blowfish Team,

Thank you for your response and recommendations. I'm pleased to inform you that we have implemented the signAndSendTransaction method as suggested.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
TopMemes.io is a memecoin tracking and trading platform on Solana. We provide real-time price tracking for 70+ tokens and enable swaps via Jupiter DEX aggregator.

SIGNANDSENTRANSACTION IMPLEMENTATION (COMPLETED):
Following your recommendation, we have updated our dApp to exclusively use Phantom's signAndSendTransaction provider method. Our implementation:

• Prioritizes signAndSendTransaction when available (Phantom's recommended method)
• Allows Blowfish/Phantom to inject Lighthouse guard instructions
• Transactions are unsigned when sent to the wallet
• Falls back gracefully for wallets that don't support this method

Key code changes made:
• /lib/jupiter.ts - Updated executeSwap() to use signAndSendTransaction
• /components/TokenDetailView.tsx - Passes signAndSendTransaction to swap handler
• /components/TokenDetailModal.tsx - Same updates for modal swap flow

You can review the implementation here:
https://github.com/therealhach/topmemes/blob/main/lib/jupiter.ts (lines 106-160)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
• All swaps go through Jupiter Aggregator API (jup.ag)
• We use standard @solana/wallet-adapter for Phantom integration
• Transactions are built server-side, unsigned, and sent to wallet for signing
• signAndSendTransaction is now the primary signing method

TEAM & SOCIAL MEDIA:

• Website: https://www.topmemes.io

REPOSITORY:
Our codebase is fully open source: https://github.com/therealhach/topmemes

SECURITY PRACTICES:
1. Jupiter API for all swaps (Solana's most trusted DEX aggregator)
2. Standard wallet adapter implementation
3. signAndSendTransaction for Phantom/Blowfish security integration
4. No custody of user funds - users sign every transaction
5. Open source codebase for full transparency

COMMUNITY VOUCH:
We are a new team without established community connections yet, but our open-source code and quick implementation of your security recommendations demonstrates our commitment to user safety and best practices.

Please let us know if you need any additional information or if there are further changes we should make. We're fully committed to providing a safe platform for our users.

Best regards,
